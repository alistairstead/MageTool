# MageTool 2#

Command line tools specifically for use during Magento development. Although Magento uses a great number of Zend Framework components and has a similar architecture to a Zend Framework application. It does not have any command line tools for use during development.

These tools have been created to facilitate a number of repetitive tasks during development. Rather than switching between mysql tools and the Magento admin system you can run simple command and improve your workflow greatly.

## Travis CI
